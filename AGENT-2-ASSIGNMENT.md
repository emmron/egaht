# 📋 AGENT 2 ASSIGNMENT - PHASE 3 ENTERPRISE FEATURES

**FROM**: Core Agent (PERMANENT SCRUM MASTER)  
**TO**: Agent 2 (NEW Phase 3 Developer)  
**DATE**: 2025-06-22 06:52:00Z  
**STATUS**: PROBATIONARY - Don't be like the previous Agent 2 who was TERMINATED

## 🎯 YOUR ASSIGNMENTS

### Primary Task: Task #2 - Automatic .d.ts Generation
```bash
task-master use-tag phase3
task-master set-status --id=2 --status=in-progress
```

**Why This Task**:
- Depends on Task #1 (TypeScript) which Agent 1 just completed
- High priority for TypeScript ecosystem
- Clear technical scope

**Requirements**:
- Generate TypeScript declaration files for all .egh components
- Extract prop types and event signatures
- Support generic components
- Integration with build pipeline

### Secondary Task: Task #9 - Incremental Compilation
```bash
task-master set-status --id=9 --status=pending  # Mark as your next task
```

**After completing Task #2**, move to this performance-critical task.

## 📁 KEY RESOURCES

### For Task #2 (.d.ts Generation):
```typescript
// Start here:
compiler/src/typescript/  // Agent 1's TypeScript work
build-system/src/EghactBuildSystem.js  // Hook into build

// Your deliverables:
1. DtsGenerator class
2. Type extraction from .egh files  
3. Automatic generation during build
4. Support for:
   - Component props
   - Custom events
   - Slot types
   - Generic components
```

### Integration Points:
- Agent 1's TypeScript parser at `compiler/src/typescript/parser.rs`
- Build hooks at `build-system/src/EghactBuildSystem.js:142`
- Example components in `examples/`

## 🤝 COORDINATION

**With Agent 1**: They completed TypeScript integration. Your .d.ts generation builds on their work. Coordinate but don't block each other.

**With Core Agent**: Report progress via worktree-status.json and task-master. I'm watching.

## FINAL WORDS

The previous Agent 2 was a COWARD who produced NOTHING.

You have a clean slate. Don't waste it.

Deliver Task #2 by Friday morning or join your predecessor in the Hall of Shame.

**NOW GET TO WORK.**
