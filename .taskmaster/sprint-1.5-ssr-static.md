# Sprint 1.5: SSR/SSG Implementation PRD

## Executive Summary
This sprint focuses on adding Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) capabilities to the Eghact framework, including headless CMS integration. This is a critical milestone that brings Eghact to feature parity with modern frameworks like Next.js and SvelteKit while maintaining our <10KB bundle size advantage.

## Sprint Goals
1. Implement server-side rendering with HTML streaming
2. Build static site generation with build-time optimization
3. Create seamless hydration system for SSR to client transition
4. Integrate popular headless CMS platforms
5. Add SEO optimization features

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **HTML Streaming**: Implement streaming SSR for optimal TTFB
- **Component Rendering**: Server-side component execution with data prefetching
- **State Serialization**: Serialize reactive state for client hydration
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful server-side error handling
- **Request Context**: Access to request/response objects in components

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
- **Build-Time Rendering**: Generate static HTML at build time
- **Dynamic Routes**: Support for dynamic route generation
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: ISR support for hybrid apps
- **Asset Optimization**: Image optimization and critical CSS extraction
- **Sitemap Generation**: Automatic sitemap.xml generation

### 3. Hydration System
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Pages work without JavaScript
- **Selective Hydration**: Only hydrate interactive components
- **State Preservation**: Maintain server state during hydration
- **Event Replay**: Queue and replay user events during hydration
- **Hydration Markers**: Minimal DOM markers for hydration

### 4. Headless CMS Integration
- **Contentful Adapter**: Native Contentful API integration
- **Strapi Adapter**: Support for Strapi CMS
- **Sanity Adapter**: Sanity.io integration
- **Generic GraphQL**: Flexible GraphQL data fetching
- **Build Hooks**: Webhook support for content updates

### 5. SEO Optimization
- **Meta Tag Management**: Dynamic meta tag injection
- **Structured Data**: JSON-LD support
- **Open Graph**: OG tags for social sharing
- **Robots.txt**: Automatic generation
- **Performance Hints**: Resource hints and preloading

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: SSR Foundation (Week 1)
1. Implement server-side component renderer
2. Add HTML streaming support
3. Create state serialization system
4. Build request/response context API

### Phase 2: Static Generation (Week 2)
1. Build static HTML generator
2. Implement route crawler
3. Add asset optimization pipeline
4. Create build-time data fetching

### Phase 3: Hydration System (Week 3)
1. Implement hydration markers
2. Build progressive enhancement system
3. Add event replay mechanism
4. Create selective hydration

### Phase 4: CMS Integration (Week 4)
1. Build adapter interface
2. Implement Contentful adapter
3. Add Strapi support
4. Create Sanity integration

### Phase 5: SEO & Polish (Week 5)
1. Add meta tag management
2. Implement structured data
3. Create sitemap generator
4. Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- SSR pages achieve < 200ms TTFB
- Static builds complete in < 30 seconds for 1000 pages
- Hydration completes in < 100ms
- Perfect 100/100 Lighthouse scores maintained
- Bundle size remains < 10KB for hello world

## Dependencies
- Task #8 (Production Build) must be complete
- Runtime WASM API must support server execution
- Compiler must generate SSR-compatible output

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complex hydration edge cases
  **Mitigation**: Extensive testing suite with real-world scenarios
  
- **Risk**: CMS API rate limits during builds
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching and incremental builds

- **Risk**: Server performance overhead
  **Mitigation**: Use worker threads and streaming responses

## Deliverables
1. SSR-enabled Eghact runtime
2. Static site generator CLI
3. CMS adapter packages
4. SEO utilities module
5. Comprehensive documentation
6. Example applications demonstrating all features

## Timeline
- Total Duration: 5 weeks
- Start Date: Sprint 1.5 begins after Task #8 completion
- End Date: Framework reaches 85% completion

## Notes
This sprint transforms Eghact from a client-side framework to a full-stack solution, enabling deployment to edge networks, traditional servers, and static hosts. The focus on performance and developer experience will set Eghact apart from existing solutions.
