# Product Requirements Document: Eghact Framework

## Executive Summary
Eghact is a revolutionary web framework that combines the best aspects of SvelteKit's developer experience with a completely new reactive paradigm. It eliminates React's complexity while providing better performance, simpler mental models, and true reactivity without virtual DOM overhead.

## Problem Statement
Current web frameworks suffer from:
- Virtual DOM overhead and complexity (React)
- Large bundle sizes and runtime overhead
- Complex state management requiring external libraries
- Poor developer experience with boilerplate code
- Confusing reactivity models
- Build tool complexity and configuration hell

## Solution Overview
Eghact introduces:
- Compile-time reactivity with zero runtime overhead
- Native TypeScript support with perfect type inference
- Built-in state management that "just works"
- File-based routing with advanced capabilities
- Server-first architecture with seamless client hydration
- Progressive enhancement by default
- Build tooling that requires zero configuration

## Key Features

### 1. True Compile-Time Reactivity
- No virtual DOM, no runtime overhead
- Signals-based reactivity compiled to vanilla JS
- Automatic dependency tracking
- Fine-grained updates at the DOM node level

### 2. Developer Experience First
- Single-file components with .egh extension
- Intuitive syntax that feels natural
- Hot module replacement that preserves state
- Instant error overlays with actionable fixes
- Built-in DevTools

### 3. Performance By Default
- Sub-10KB runtime
- Automatic code splitting
- Streaming SSR with progressive enhancement
- Edge-first deployment
- Automatic critical CSS extraction

### 4. Modern Architecture
- TypeScript-first with perfect inference
- Built on modern web standards (Web Components, ES Modules)
- Native browser APIs, no polyfills needed
- Service worker integration for offline-first apps

## Technical Requirements

### Core Runtime
- Written in Rust for maximum performance
- Compiles to WebAssembly where beneficial
- Zero dependencies in production builds
- Tree-shakeable to the extreme

### Compiler
- AST-based transformation pipeline
- Incremental compilation
- Error recovery and suggestions
- Plugin system for extensibility

### Development Server
- Instant startup (< 100ms)
- Module graph optimization
- Automatic HTTPS with local certificates
- WebSocket-based HMR

### Build System
- Parallel processing
- Deterministic builds
- Docker-first deployment
- Automatic optimization (images, fonts, etc.)

## Component Model

### Basic Component Structure
```eghact
<template>
  <div class="counter">
    <button @click="count++">Count: {count}</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
let count = 0;
</script>

<style>
.counter {
  padding: 1rem;
}
</style>
```

### Advanced Features
- Reactive statements with $:
- Component composition with slots
- Context API for prop drilling
- Lifecycle hooks that make sense
- Async components with Suspense

## Routing System

### File-Based Routing
- Dynamic routes with [param]
- Catch-all routes with [...slug]
- Nested layouts
- Route groups for organization
- API routes alongside pages

### Data Loading
- Server-side data fetching
- Parallel route loading
- Request deduplication
- Automatic error boundaries
- Loading states

## State Management

### Local State
- Reactive variables with let
- Computed values with $:
- Stores for shared state
- Persistence helpers

### Global State
- Built-in store system
- Time-travel debugging
- State hydration from server
- Optimistic updates

## Deployment

### Target Platforms
- Vercel/Netlify (zero-config)
- AWS Lambda@Edge
- Cloudflare Workers
- Docker containers
- Static export

### Build Outputs
- Optimized bundles
- Service worker
- Manifest files
- Sitemap generation
- RSS feeds

## Success Metrics
- Time to first byte < 50ms
- Bundle size < 10KB for hello world
- 100/100 Lighthouse scores by default
- Developer satisfaction > 95%
- Build times < 1s for medium apps

## MVP Scope

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Month 1-2)
- Basic component model
- Reactivity system
- Compiler pipeline
- Development server

### Phase 2: Routing & Data (Month 3-4)
- File-based routing
- Data loading patterns
- Error handling
- Loading states

### Phase 3: Production Ready (Month 5-6)
- Build optimizations
- Deployment adapters
- Documentation
- Developer tools

### Phase 4: Ecosystem (Month 7+)
- UI component library
- Testing framework
- IDE integrations
- Community plugins

## Technical Constraints
- Must support all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js 18+ for development
- No legacy browser support (IE11)
- Progressive enhancement required

## Competition Analysis
- React: Too complex, large bundle sizes
- Vue: Better but still has virtual DOM
- Svelte: Good ideas, poor execution on SvelteKit
- Solid: Close but lacks framework features
- Qwik: Interesting but too magical

## Why Eghact Will Win
1. Simplicity without sacrificing power
2. Performance that delights users
3. Developer experience that sparks joy
4. Community-first development
5. Future-proof architecture
