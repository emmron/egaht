# Task ID: 10
# Title: Zero-Config Deployment Adapters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create zero-configuration deployment adapters for major platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Workers. These adapters will generate the necessary configuration and output structure for each specific platform.
# Details:
For each target platform, create an adapter package (e.g., `@eghact/adapter-vercel`). The adapter, when added to the project, will modify the build output (Task 8) to match the platform's expected format. For Vercel/Netlify, this might mean generating a specific serverless function structure. For Cloudflare Workers, it would output a single script compatible with the Workers runtime. For static export, it would generate plain HTML/CSS/JS files.

# Test Strategy:
For each adapter, create a sample application, build it using the adapter, and deploy it to the target platform. Write an end-to-end test script that verifies the deployment is successful and the application is fully functional on the public URL. The process should require no manual configuration from the user.
