It must have zero production dependencies and be extremely lightweight (<10KB).",

Define a lean API for DOM node creation, updates, and event handling that the Eghact compiler will target. For example: `eghact.createElement('div')`, `eghact.setText(node, 'new text')`, `eghact.listen(node, 'click', handler)`. This runtime will be the only piece of 'framework' code that ships to the browser.",

Traverse the AST to identify reactive variables (`let`), reactive statements (`$:`), and event bindings (`@click`). Transform these into direct DOM manipulation calls that interface with the Core Runtime (Task 1).

To test rebuilds, the script will make targeted changes to different file types (e.g., a leaf component, a widely used utility function) and measure the time taken for the dev server to report completion.\n\n**Performance Monitoring Dashboard:**\n1.  Build a simple, static single-page application (SPA) for the dashboard.\n2.  The CI pipeline will be configured to run the benchmark suite on every commit to the `main` branch.\n3.  Upon completion, the CI job will output the results as a JSON object, which includes the commit hash, timestamp, and all measured metrics. This object will be appended to a `performance-history.json` file stored in a publicly accessible location (like a separate branch or a cloud bucket).\n4.
