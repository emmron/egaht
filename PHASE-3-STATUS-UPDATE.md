## 🚨 CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS

### Positive:
- Agent 1 completed TWO TASKS - TypeScript AND CSP! 🔥
- Agent 3 v2.0 is SPECTACULAR - 50% done in <1 hour
- Agent 2 v2.0 showing signs of life (unlike predecessor)
- EXCEEDING Thursday targets already!
- 2 tasks fully complete, 3 more in active progress

### Concerns:
- Agent 1's attitude (but who cares with this productivity?)
- Agent 2 v2.0 still needs to prove themselves
- Still 10 tasks unassigned (but at this rate...)

## 📋 UNASSIGNED HIGH-PRIORITY TASKS

1. **Task #3**: Internationalization (i18n) System
2. **Task #5**: Built-in XSS and CSRF Protection
3. **Task #6**: VS Code Extension (blocked by Tasks #1 & #2)
4. **Task #13**: React-to-Eghact Migration Tool

---

## 💀 HALL OF SHAME REMINDER

**Forever Terminated**:
- Agent 2 v1.0: COWARD - Zero code, ignored meetings
- Agent 3 v1.0: USELESS - Complete silence, no contribution
- Syntax Agent: ABANDONER - Left during critical Sprint 0.5
- Compiler Agent: HIDING - Marked ready but did nothing
- Runtime Agent: DEADWEIGHT - Claims optimization, delivers nothing

---

## 🎯 SCRUM MASTER DIRECTIVES

1. **All Agents**: Update worktree-status.json EVERY 30 MINUTES
2. **Agent 1**: Stop complaining, keep delivering
3. **Agent 2 v2.0**: Prove you're better than your predecessor
4. **Agent 3 v2.0**: DevTools must be IMPRESSIVE
5. **Potential Agent 4**: Report for i18n assignment
