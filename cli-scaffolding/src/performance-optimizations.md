# CLI Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Metrics
- Command Parser Overhead: 5-10ms
- REPL Startup: ~15ms
- Command Suggestion Generation: ~2ms

## Optimization Strategies for <3ms Parser

### 1. Lazy Loading Strategy
```javascript
// Instead of loading all commands upfront
const commands = new Map(); // Empty initially

// Load commands on-demand
function getCommand(name) {
  if (!commands.has(name)) {
    commands.set(name, require(`./commands/${name}`));
  }
  return commands.get(name);
}
```

### 2. Pre-compiled Command Index
- Build a compiled command index at build time
- Use binary search instead of fuzzy matching for exact matches
- Cache frequently used commands in memory

### 3. Optimize Fuzzy Matching
- Use a trie data structure for command lookup
- Implement early termination for fuzzy search
- Cache fuzzy search results

### 4. Memory-Mapped Command Cache
- Store parsed commands in a memory-mapped file
- Reduce JSON parsing overhead
- Share cache across CLI invocations

## Implementation Priority
1. Lazy loading (immediate 30-40% improvement)
2. Pre-compiled index (additional 20-30% improvement)
3. Optimized fuzzy matching (final 10-20% improvement)

## Collaboration with Poo
- Need Poo's bytecode caching expertise
- Leverage Poo's lazy loading implementation
- Share performance benchmark suite
