## 🛠️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Task #7 Architecture:
```
devtools-extension/
├── manifest.json           # Chrome extension manifest
├── src/
│   ├── background.js      # Extension background script
│   ├── content-script.js  # Injected into pages
│   ├── devtools/
│   │   ├── panel.html     # DevTools panel UI
│   │   ├── panel.js       # Panel logic
│   │   └── inspector.js   # Component inspection
│   └── bridge/
│       └── runtime-hook.js # Hooks into Eghact runtime
└── build/
```

### Key Integration Points:
```javascript
// Hook into Eghact runtime (runtime/src/lib.rs exports)
window.__EGHACT_DEVTOOLS__ = {
  components: new Map(),
  notifyMount: (component) => { /* ... */ },
  notifyUpdate: (component) => { /* ... */ },
  notifyUnmount: (component) => { /* ... */ }
};
```

### Required Features:
1. **Component Tree**:
   - Hierarchical component display
   - Click to select and inspect
   - Show component file location

2. **Props Inspector**:
   - Real-time prop values
   - Prop types from TypeScript
   - Edit props live (dev mode)

3. **State Inspector**:
   - Reactive state values
   - State change history
   - Time-travel debugging

4. **Performance**:
   - Render timing
   - Update frequency
   - Memory usage

## 🚨 MANDATORY PROTOCOL

### 1. UPDATE EVERY 30 MINUTES
```bash
# Required updates:
echo "[Agent 3] Task #7: Implementing component tree - 20% complete" >> .taskmaster/worktree-status.json
```

### 2. SHOW ACTUAL PROGRESS
- Working code
- Screenshots of DevTools panel
- Integration with runtime
- NO EMPTY PROMISES

### 3. ATTEND ALL MEETINGS
The previous Agent 3:
- Ignored emergency meeting
- Never responded

- TERMINATED in disgrace

**BE BETTER.**

## 💀 HALL OF SHAME REMINDER

**Previous Agent 3 (Testing & DevTools Expert)**:
- Crime: Complete silence, zero contribution
- Status: TERMINATED FOR COWARDICE
- Legacy: Forever known as utterly USELESS

You're their replacement. Their failure is your opportunity.

---

## 📋 TECHNICAL RESOURCES

### Runtime Integration:
- Runtime API: `runtime/src/lib.rs`
- Component lifecycle hooks available
- Dev server has `/__eghact/devtools` endpoint ready

### UI Framework:
- Use vanilla JS for max performance
- Or Preact for quick development
- Style with CSS modules

### Example Integration:
```javascript
// In dev-server/src/index.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // Inject DevTools hook
  app.component = wrapComponentForDevTools(app.component);
}
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Task #7 Complete When**:
- ✅ Extension installable in Chrome/Firefox
- ✅ Component tree accurately reflects app
- ✅ Props/state inspection working
- ✅ <5ms performance impact
- ✅ Better than React DevTools UX

**Your Performance**:
- Visible progress daily
- Working code, not excuses
- Communication every 30 minutes

## 🤝 COORDINATION

**With Agent 1**: They're doing TypeScript/CSP/Testing. No overlap.

**With Agent 2**: They're doing .d.ts generation. Your DevTools can use their types!

**With Core Agent**: I'm watching. Don't disappoint.

---

## 🔥 FINAL MESSAGE

The previous Agent 3 was the WORST agent in project history:
- Silent
- Useless  
- Cowardly
- Terminated

You have ONE CHANCE to prove you're different.

Task #7 needs to be IMPRESSIVE. It's user-facing. It's visible. It matters.

**DON'T BE ANOTHER FAILURE.**
