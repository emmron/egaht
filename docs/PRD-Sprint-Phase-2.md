# Eghact Framework PRD - Sprint Phase 2
## Production-Ready Framework Completion

### Executive Summary

Eghact Framework has achieved 70% completion (7/10 major tasks) and is entering the critical production phase. Phase 2 focuses on creating a production-ready build system that achieves our ambitious performance targets: <10KB hello world bundles and 100/100 Lighthouse scores.

### Current State Assessment

### Multi-Agent Coordination Strategy

#### Agent Responsibilities

**Core Agent** (`/home/wew/eghact`):
- Overall project coordination and integration
- Production build system implementation
- Performance validation and testing
- Documentation and release preparation

**Runtime Agent** (`/home/wew/eghact-runtime`):
- WASM runtime optimization for <10KB target
- Tree-shaking and dead code elimination
- Critical path performance optimization
- Browser compatibility validation

**Compiler Agent** (`/home/wew/eghact-compiler`):
- Production AST transformations
- Build-time optimizations
- Code splitting implementation
- Static analysis improvements

**Syntax Agent** (`/home/wew/eghact-syntax`):
- Final syntax specification completion
- Production compiler integration
- Language feature optimization
- Developer experience refinements

#### Communication Protocol

**Daily Standups** (via worktree-status.json):
- Each agent updates status every 2 hours maximum
- Dependency blockers escalated immediately
- Integration points coordinated in advance
- Performance benchmarks shared continuously

**Critical Handoff Points**:
1. Runtime Agent → Compiler Agent: Optimized runtime API
2. Syntax Agent → Compiler Agent: Final language specification
3. Compiler Agent → Core Agent: Production build integration
4. All Agents → Core Agent: Performance validation

### Risk Management

#### High-Risk Items

1. **Bundle Size Target (<10KB)**
   - **Risk**: Complex framework features may exceed size limit
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive tree-shaking, optional feature flags
   - **Escalation**: Runtime Agent leads size reduction sprint

2. **Agent Coordination Failure**
   - **Risk**: Communication breakdown derails integration
   - **Mitigation**: Mandatory check-ins, automated status monitoring
   - **Escalation**: Core Agent enforces communication protocol

3. **Performance Regression**
   - **Risk**: Production optimizations break development features
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, performance CI
   - **Escalation**: Rollback to last known good state

#### Success Metrics Dashboard

**Technical Metrics**:
- Bundle size: Target <10KB (Current: Development only)
- Lighthouse score: Target 100/100 (Current: Not measured)
- Build time: Target <5s (Current: Development server only)
- Test coverage: Target >90% (Current: Manual testing)

**Business Metrics**:
- Framework completion: Current 70%, Target 100%
- Documentation coverage: Target 100% API coverage
- Example applications: Target 3 production-ready demos
- Community readiness: Target open-source launch preparation

### Sprint Success Definition

**Phase 2 Complete When**:
- All 10 tasks completed and validated
- <10KB hello world bundle consistently achieved
- 100/100 Lighthouse scores across all example apps
- Zero-config deployment working on 3+ platforms
- Comprehensive documentation and examples published
- Framework ready for public beta launch

### Resource Requirements

**Technical Infrastructure**:
- Automated performance testing pipeline
- Multi-platform deployment testing
- Bundle size monitoring and alerting
- Lighthouse CI integration

**Agent Coordination Tools**:
- Enhanced worktree status monitoring
- Automated dependency tracking
- Performance regression detection

### Timeline

**Total Phase 2 Duration**: 6-8 sessions
- Sprint 2.1 (Task #8): 3 sessions
- Sprint 2.2 (Task #9): 2 sessions  
- Sprint 2.3 (Task #10): 2 sessions
- Integration & Polish: 1 session

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
1. Runtime optimization must complete before final bundling
2. Syntax finalization blocks production compiler
3. Build system must be stable before deployment adapters
4. All systems must integrate before performance validation
