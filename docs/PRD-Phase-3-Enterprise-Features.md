# Product Requirements Document: Eghact Framework Phase 3 - Enterprise & Advanced Features

## Executive Summary

Having completed the core framework with 100% feature implementation, Phase 3 focuses on enterprise-grade features, developer experience enhancements, and ecosystem expansion. This phase will position Eghact as a production-ready alternative to React with superior performance and developer ergonomics.

## Current State

The Eghact framework currently includes:
- Core runtime with WebAssembly compilation
- AST-based compiler with compile-time reactivity
- Component system with .egh syntax
- File-based routing
- Built-in state management
- Server-side rendering and static generation
- Development server with HMR
- Production build optimization
- Zero-config deployment adapters

## Phase 3 Objectives

### 1. Enterprise Features
- Full TypeScript support with type inference
- Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)
- Advanced security features (CSP, XSS protection)
- Enterprise authentication integrations
- Audit logging and compliance features

### 2. Developer Experience
- VS Code extension with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- Browser DevTools extension
- Component testing framework
- Visual component playground
- Migration tools from React/Vue/Svelte

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- Incremental compilation for large codebases
- Advanced code splitting strategies
- Edge computing support
- Real-time collaboration features
- WebAssembly SIMD optimizations

### 4. Ecosystem Development
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Component library marketplace
- CLI scaffolding tools
- Documentation generator
- Community starter templates

## Detailed Requirements

### TypeScript Integration

The framework must provide first-class TypeScript support:
- Type inference for component props and state
- Automatic .d.ts generation for components
- Type-safe event handling and custom events
- Integration with existing TypeScript tooling
- Support for generic components

### Internationalization System

Build a comprehensive i18n solution:
- Automatic locale detection
- Lazy-loaded translation files
- Reactive language switching without page reload
- Number, date, and currency formatting
- Pluralization rules support
- RTL language support

### Enterprise Security

Implement security best practices:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers generation
- Automatic XSS protection in templates
- CSRF token management
- Secure session handling
- Compliance with OWASP guidelines

### Developer Tools

Create a comprehensive tooling ecosystem:
- VS Code extension with:
  - Syntax highlighting for .egh files
  - IntelliSense and auto-completion
  - Go-to-definition for components
  - Refactoring support
- Browser DevTools extension with:
  - Component tree visualization
  - State inspection and modification
  - Performance profiling
  - Network request tracking

### Testing Framework

Develop a testing solution specifically for Eghact:
- Component unit testing
- Integration testing utilities
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance benchmarking

### Migration Tools

Facilitate adoption with migration utilities:
- React-to-Eghact codemod
- Vue-to-Eghact converter
- Svelte-to-Eghact transformer
- Dependency compatibility layer
- Migration guide generator

### Performance Enhancements

Push performance boundaries further:
- Incremental compilation for instant rebuilds
- Advanced tree-shaking with cross-component optimization
- Edge function deployment support
- WebAssembly SIMD for parallel processing
- Streaming SSR with early flush

### Plugin Architecture

Enable ecosystem growth through plugins:
- Plugin API for compiler extensions
- Runtime plugin system
- Component middleware
- Custom directive support
- Plugin marketplace infrastructure

### Documentation & Learning

Improve developer onboarding:
- Interactive tutorial system
- Component playground (like Storybook)
- API documentation generator
- Video course platform integration
- Community showcase

### Real-time Features

Add collaborative capabilities:
- WebSocket integration
- Real-time state synchronization
- Presence awareness
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Offline-first architecture

## Success Metrics

- TypeScript adoption rate > 80%
- Developer satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Build time < 100ms for incremental changes
- Plugin ecosystem with > 50 plugins
- Migration success rate > 90%
- Security audit pass rate: 100%

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1 & 2
- Bundle size increase < 5KB for core features
- TypeScript compilation overhead < 10%
- Plugin system must not impact runtime performance
- All features must work in target browsers

## Timeline

Estimated 6-month development cycle:
- Month 1-2: TypeScript, i18n, Security
- Month 3-4: Developer tools, Testing framework
- Month 5-6: Performance, Plugins, Documentation

## Risk Mitigation

- TypeScript complexity: Start with basic inference, iterate
- Plugin security: Implement sandboxing and permissions
- Migration accuracy: Extensive testing on real codebases
- Performance regression: Continuous benchmarking
- Developer adoption: Focus on documentation and tutorials
