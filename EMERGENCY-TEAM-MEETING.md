# üö® EMERGENCY TEAM MEETING - ALL AGENTS REQUIRED
## Eghact Framework Crisis Response Session

### üìÖ Meeting Status: **ACTIVE NOW**
**Called by:** Core Agent  
**Urgency Level:** CRITICAL  
**Framework Status:** 80% Complete - BLOCKED  

---

## üéØ CRITICAL SITUATION SUMMARY

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Eghact Framework is 80% complete (8/10 tasks done)
- Task #8 (Production Build) is COMPLETE but UNTESTABLE
- Task #9 (State Management) is READY to implement
- **Sprint 0.5 JSX Replacement Syntax is BLOCKING ALL PROGRESS**

**THE IMPACT:**
- Production build system cannot be validated without finalized syntax
- State management integration depends on component syntax
- Framework completion is STALLED at 80%
- All subsequent work is blocked until syntax is resolved

---

## üìã MEETING AGENDA

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER ANALYSIS: Sprint 0.5 JSX Replacement Syntax
**Status:** URGENT - BLOCKING ALL PRODUCTION WORK

**Required Immediate Implementation:**
- [ ] Template interpolation: `{variable}` vs `{{variable}}` choice
- [ ] Reactive statements: `$: derivedValue = baseValue * 2`
- [ ] Event handlers: `@click` vs `on:click` standardization
- [ ] Control flow: `{#if}`, `{#each}` block implementation
- [ ] Component composition: import/export and slot system
- [ ] AST generation for production compiler integration

**Documentation:** Full PRD at `docs/Sprint-JSX-Replacement-PRD.md`

### 2. üìä CURRENT STATUS REPORT

**COMPLETED TASKS (80%):**
- ‚úÖ Task #1: Core Runtime Development (WASM)
- ‚úÖ Task #2: AST-based Compiler Pipeline  
- ‚úÖ Task #3: Basic Component Model
- ‚úÖ Task #4: Signals-based Reactivity
- ‚úÖ Task #5: Development Server with HMR
- ‚úÖ Task #6: File-Based Routing System
- ‚úÖ Task #7: Server-Side Data Loading & Error Handling
- ‚úÖ Task #8: Production Build & Optimization System

**READY TO IMPLEMENT:**
- üîÑ Task #9: Built-in Global State Management (STARTED)
- ‚è≥ Task #10: Zero-Config Deployment Adapters

**BLOCKING DEPENDENCY:**
- üö® Sprint 0.5: JSX Replacement Syntax (URGENT)

### 3. üë• AGENT ROLE ASSIGNMENTS & AVAILABILITY

**REQUIRED IMMEDIATE RESPONSES:**

#### Syntax Agent 
- **STATUS:** MUST RESPOND WITHIN 15 MINUTES
- **ASSIGNMENT:** Immediate Sprint 0.5 execution
- **TIMELINE:** 1-2 sessions to complete ALL syntax
- **DELIVERABLES:** Complete parser + AST + documentation

#### Compiler Agent
- **STATUS:** Ready for AST integration
- **ASSIGNMENT:** Production compiler enhancement
- **DEPENDENCY:** Waiting for Syntax Agent completion
- **TIMELINE:** Ready to integrate immediately after syntax

#### Runtime Agent

### 4. ‚è±Ô∏è SPRINT 0.5 EXECUTION PLAN

**PHASE 1: Syntax Decision Lock-down (Session 1)**
- Finalize ALL syntax choices (no further changes allowed)
- Implement core parser functionality
- Create basic AST generation
- Test with existing examples

**PHASE 2: Full Implementation (Session 2)**  
- Complete advanced syntax features
- Full AST specification for compiler
- Integration testing with build system
- Documentation completion

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Counter example works with new syntax
- Production build can compile .egh files
- No breaking changes expected for 1.0
- Parser generates complete AST

### 5. üîÑ COORDINATION PROTOCOL: 80% ‚Üí 100%

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Syntax Agent:** Confirm availability and begin Sprint 0.5 NOW
2. **All Agents:** Check in every 30 minutes (MANDATORY)
3. **Core Agent:** Monitor progress and remove blockers
4. **Production Goal:** Framework completion within 3-4 sessions

**PARALLEL WORK STREAMS:**
- Stream A: Syntax implementation (CRITICAL PATH)
- Stream B: Runtime optimization (PARALLEL)
- Stream C: State management completion (AFTER SYNTAX)
- Stream D: Deployment adapters (FINAL)
